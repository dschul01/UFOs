# UFOs
Utilize JavaScript and Bootstrap to develop a website containing a filterable table. 

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop a website containing UFO sighting data utilizing VS Code, HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap components.  A fully dynamic table is built using data stored in a JavaScript array allowing users to 
key in multiple filters to narrow down results of UFO sightings around the world.  Additionally, the website is customized using Bootstrap to make it a more visually appealing site.

## Results
### Performing a Search in the Website
The final project is an interactive webpage which allows users to parse UFO sightings data.  A webpage was built to view the data in HTML and a filterable dynamic table that presents the UFO sightings.  The most complex challenge of this project was creating the filterable table that allows users to filter data by date, 
city, state, country or shape.  The following steps and images walk a user on the process of using the search criteria.

This first image shows the complete table of sightings without any search criteria selected.  This entire default view will provide all sightings collected within our dataset (only a subset is shown here due to size).

This image shows how a user may filter down the data by entering criteria within the searchable fields.  The example shows the user entering a data within the 'Enter Date' field.  After pressing the 'Enter' key, the dataset is filtered by the specific criteria.  Similarly, criteria may be entered into the other searchable fields, such as "City", "State", etc.

The user will see criteria in the searchable fields as examples of the syntax to be entered in order to narrow down the results.

## Summary
### Design Flaw 

There is a flaw with how the client requested this website to filter data.
